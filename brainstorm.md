# iOS App Brainstorm 
### Kaila Aquino 

## Ideas: 
1. Habit tracker: Users list their habits, record if completed for each day 
3. Journal Prompt: a new journal prompt is asked each day 
4. Activity suggestions: a new activity is generated each day 
5. Goal planner: goals get broken up into smaller tasks, users can select what task to do for certain days 

## Top 2
1. Goal planner
2. Activity Suggestions 

## Idea Evaluation 
1. Goal planner: 
    - Mobile: The user is able to quickly access their goals/tasks and can recieve push notifications to be reminded to complete their task of the day. 
    - Story: Motivates the user to work towards their goals and relieves the user from decision fatigue.  
    - Market: This app targets wide audience of users who are ambitious yet experience difficulty with making decisions. This group includes students, young adults, and anyone who may be experincing burn out, anxiety, or ADHD.
    - Habit: This app is designed for daily use so users can make continous progress towards their goals. 
    - Scope: For the MVP, the users are able to create goals and break them down into subgoals. For each day, a task will get recommended for the user's daily focus. The user can mark their task as done. 

2. Activity suggestions
    - Mobile: The user sets a certain time for daily activity suggestion notfications with a customized audio sound. The user can generate more suggestions by accessing the generator on their phone at any time of the day. 
    - Story: Users can be reminded to do something fun for each day. The visual reminder can motivate users to accomplish their activity. 
    - Market: This app targets those who may run out of things to do throughout the day. The audience can be students who are on summer break and experiencing boredom, adults who want to add excitement to their daily lives, and families who need something to do with their kids. 
    - Habit: Users are to open this app at least once a day. The notifications will encourage users to view the details of the activity. If users do not like the suggestion, another activity may be suggested. The goal is to inspire users, not to consume their time on their screens. 
    - Scope: For the MVP, the users will be able to receive a randomly generated generalized activity for a dataset of activities. 

## Final idea: Goal Planner - Daily Slice
